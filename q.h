            temperature in Fahrenheit and identifiy those tempertures in 
            the form of Celsius and kelvin and to print them as output

// @todo: Provide function-level documentation header as explained in Assignment 2 specs ...
// It is important that you provide function-level documentation header in
// this [header] file since this file is what you would provide to your
// clients and other users to solve problems related to conversions of
// temperature from Fahrenheit scale to other scales. In a commercial environment,
// the source file q.c containing the definition of function temp_converter is
// your intellectual property and should therefore be kept private. Instead,
// you'll provide your clients the object file q.o [obtained by only compiling q.c].
// Therefore, your clients will know how to use the function temp_converter
// only by reading this function-level documentation header ...

// @todo: Now, provide the declaration or prototype of function temp_converter
// that takes a parameter of type int and returns nothing ...


// declaration or prototype of a function that recives temperature in Fahrenheit and prints temperaturn in Fahrenheit Celsius and kelvin
// that takes a parameter of type is double and returns no value
void temp_converter(double temp);
